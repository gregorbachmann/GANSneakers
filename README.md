# GAN for Sneakers
This project uses DCGAN to generate new sneakers.

## Data
I created a dataset consisting of images of sneakers viewed from the side. I scrapped images from websites such as **Goat.com** and cleaned the resulting data. This resulted in approximately 6000 pictures that I used for training.
As I own no rights to these images, I cannot publish them here. However, my GAN framework can be used for any sort of image data.
